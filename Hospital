 Scenario:
You are designing a Hospital Billing System for managing patient treatments and calculating the final bill in Rupees (₹). Each patient can either be an Outpatient or Inpatient. Based on their type, the hospital charges different fees. Your task is to build a program where the user can input details of the patient, add treatments or services, and calculate the final bill.

 Problem Requirements:
1. Instance variables should be used to store patient details like the patient's name, type of admission (Outpatient or Inpatient), and the accumulated treatment cost in Rupees.
2. Static variables should be used to store general hospital information like the hospital name and base consultation fee, which is ₹1000.
3. Local variables should be used within methods to handle temporary calculations.
4. Use constructors to initialize the patient’s details like their name and type of admission.
5. Implement methods for the following operations:
   - Add a treatment or service and update the treatment cost.
   - Apply special charges (for Inpatients).
   - Calculate and display the final bill.
6. Use decision-making statements to manage operations such as:
   - Deciding if special charges apply based on the patient's type.
   - Deciding whether a service is available.
7. Use operators to calculate the bill (addition for treatments, multiplication for charges).
8. Use different data types such as `String`, `double`, and `int` for patient information, costs, and calculations.
9. Ensure there’s no use of arrays, collections, inheritance, polymorphism, or data structures.

 Scenario Description:
- Outpatients: Pay a base consultation fee of ₹1000 and additional fees for any services or treatments they receive.
- Inpatients: Pay a base consultation fee of ₹1000 and additional charges of 20% on the total treatment cost for hospital stay.
- The user should be able to add treatments (with their cost) to the patient’s bill in Rupees.
- Once all treatments are added, the final bill can be calculated and displayed in Rupees format.

 Constraints:
- Treatment costs should be greater than ₹0.
- Only Inpatients should have an extra charge for hospital stay.
- The bill should always include the base consultation fee.

 Input:
- A single line containing the patient’s name, type (Inpatient or Outpatient), followed by a list of services or treatments and their respective costs in Rupees.

 Expected Behavior:
- For each service or treatment, add its cost to the patient’s bill.
- If the patient is an Inpatient, add 20% of the total treatment cost as hospital stay charges.
- Display the final bill in Rupees format.

 Example Input:
```
Rajesh Inpatient consultation 5000 surgery 20000
```

 Example Output:
```
Patient Name: Rajesh
Patient Type: Inpatient
Total Treatment Cost: ₹25,000.00
Hospital Stay Charges (20%): ₹5,000.00
Final Bill: ₹31,000.00
```

 Example Input 2:
```
Meera Outpatient consultation 1000 lab_tests 3000
```

 Example Output 2:
```
Patient Name: Meera
Patient Type: Outpatient
Total Treatment Cost: ₹4,000.00
Final Bill: ₹5,000.00
```

 Your Task:
Write a Java program based on the scenario, adhering to the provided constraints, and ensuring that the final output is displayed in Rupees format (₹).
